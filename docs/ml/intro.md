# Intro

Everybody is talking about A.I these days. From [DALL.E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/) to its different applications in software and robotics, A.I has started spreading its roots to being one of those technologies that will actually change the face of earth.

Here's something cool. I asked [GPT-3](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-3-apps/)'s API to write a song on House Of Geeks, and the results might surprise you ðŸ¤¯.

You can go and play around with this [here](https://beta.openai.com/playground).

So, coming back to what you are here for. The **Community of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence** has curated some relevant resources which can help you start this journey into the unknown.

Since Machine Learning is a very subjective field and how one person might approach to learn and understand the things might be very different from how I (the writer) did it and is still doing it (there's no end to it). But there are certain things, certain overlaps that cannot be ignored. Once you get comfortable with those basics, you can build cool stuff, really cool stuff!!

## Walkthrough

The various sections consist of tutorials, blogs, GitHub repositories, projects or simply links that will help you learn:
**Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, **NLP**, **Computer Vision** and a little bit of **Math**, just a little :) (yeah, can't ignore it)

Before starting anything I'd like you to read this article on [Superintelligence](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html).
