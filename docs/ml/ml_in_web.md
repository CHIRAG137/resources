# ML in Web

Well you know how to make a face recognition model. Cool. Want to take it one step further and integrate that ML model into a website. Two technologies coming together to make things better.
This is what happens in the real world. A stand-alone model when combined with web or app boosts the potential of the whole architecture. 

## [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) 

After you make a model, there are several ways in which you can use it in production. The most basic one being making an API of it using the [Flask Web Framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/). At this point it's good to learn a web framework and you can follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwZwr5Tvyxo&list=PL-osiE80TeTs4UjLw5MM6OjgkjFeUxCYH) playlist.

Now moving onwards with how you can integrate ML with web - [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L_xAWDRs7w&list=PLZoTAELRMXVPBaLN3e-uoVRR9hlRFRfUc) playlist by Krish Naik can help you understand how that is done with some projects that you can code along.

## [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js)

The official [TensorFlow.js docs](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) have enough to get you started with it. There, You can learn about training models, transfer learning and deployment.

A very cool application of [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) is [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).

> Some more tutorials to help you wrap your head around ML in Javascript:
- [freeCodeCamp: TensorFlow.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoYfa6mYOG4)
- [The Coding Train: TF.js intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt3ZABW5lD0&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YIeVA3dNxbR9PYj4wV31oQ)
- [The Coding Train: TF.js Color Classifier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y59-frfKR58&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bmMRCIoTi72aNWHo7epX4L) - This is more of a project based learning. Really good.
