# Core Electronics

**Core Electronics** can be broadly divided into two sections: **Analog Electronics** and **Digital Electronics**

Here are some resources to learn **Analog Electronics**:

| Course | Format | Details |
|--------|-------------------|---------|
| [Electronic Devices and Circuit Theory (11th Edition)-Prentice Hall (2012)](https://1lib.in/book/2369321/cb7e08)| book | Written by Robert L. Boylestad, Louis Nashelsky, this is a must read! |
| [Integrated Electronics](https://1lib.in/book/3335804/8ddc08) | book | Written by Millmain and Halkias, great pick for Integrated Systems |
| [Op Amps Design Application and Troubleshooting](https://1lib.in/book/465750/4cca61) | book | Written by David Terrell, introduces you to Op Amp design |
| [Design_of_Analog_CMOS_Integrated_Circuit_2nd_Edition](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyYrySVqmyVPzvVlPW-TTzHhNWg1J_0LU)| videos | These lectures will provide a deep insight into Electronic devices and circuits |
<br />


Next up we have **Digital Electronics**, so brace yourselves!!<br />

<br />

Other than `Analog` and `Digital` **Electronics**, we have some more areas that are vitalfor becoming proficient in the area of **Core Electronics**

**Signals & Systems** and **Electromagnetic Theory & Antenna** play a vital role in the field of electronics. They are vital as the whole of `communication` infrastructure is based of off these fields. 

Here are some places you could get well-versed with **Signals & Systems**

| Course | Format | Details |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| [Principles of Linear Signals and Systems](https://1lib.in/book/2086829/a6654f) | book | Written by B.P. Lathi, this is a good read for S&S |
| [Signals and Systems: Analysis Using Transform Methods & MATLAB](https://1lib.in/book/1226584/5e851a) | book | This can be referred to if you are into simulation of signals using MATLAB |
| [Advanced Image and Video Processing Using MATLAB](https://1lib.in/book/3661071/36660d) | book | This is good in-case you want to make a deep dive into Image and Video Processing |
<br />

Last but not the least we have **Electromagnetic Theory & Antenna**

| Course | Format | Details |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| [Elements of Electromagnetics](https://1lib.in/book/5395217/b03345) | book | Written by Sadiku, this introduces you to the concepts of Electromagnetics |
| [Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design ](https://1lib.in/book/2739531/71065b) | book | This book talks about the Antenna theory, it's basics and design |
| [Antenna and EM Modeling with Matlab](https://1lib.in/book/1270182/6923e8) | book | This book takes both EM and Antenna concepts to simulation using MATLAB. |
<br />

This section ends here, hope these resources help you get a good undertsanding principles of `Electronics` and how they are being used in devices around us on a regular basis!!
