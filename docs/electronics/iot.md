Before you ask us what exactly is **IoT**, we would like you to go through this video [What is IoT?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mBO2vqLv38) to get to know the vast applications of this amazing field which spreads from your VR gear to the AR game `Pokemon` the world went crazy for!!  

There are few courses that you should refer to get started with your IoT journey. 

> [Introduction to Internet of Things](https://onlinecourses.nptel.ac.in/noc21_cs17/preview) by NPTEL, it introduces you to IoT in a friendly and easy to understand way.

> [Internet of Things Full Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0gWfVCSGQQ) by Edureka is a 4 hour course that introduces you to the different aspects of IoT.
