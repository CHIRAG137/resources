# Robotics

Robotics is a branch of `electrical engineering`, `electronic engineering`, `mechanical engineering` 
and `computer science`. It deals with the design, construction, operation, and application of robots, as well as computer systems for their control, sensory feedback and information processing.

In the field of `Robotics`, it is necessary that you know about certain microcontrollers such as Ardunio, ESP32, Raspberry Pi.

Arduino plays an important role in robotics. For beginning with Arduino, you can go
through the following 3 articles:<br />

**[A tour of the Arduino UNO board](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/developers/a-tour-of-the-arduino-uno-board)**<br />

**[Arduino programming for Beginners-1](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/developers/arduino-programming-for-beginners/)**<br />

**[Arduino programming for Beginners -2](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/developers/arduino-programming-for-beginners-2/)**<br />

Getting into some serious business here we have some video tutorials that you can refer to for these `Micro-controllers`

| Course | Format | Details |

<br />

Now,in order to practise online we have a few online websites or IDEs to run your
code virtually such as **Tinker Cad**, **Proteus** and **Eagle Cad**.
<br />
