# What to expect?

Hey there! So you wanna start learning about various technologies and how their use cases have changed the world at large. But you are probably lost in blogs, video tutorials and courses scrambled all over the internet.

Where to start? What to do first? What is the right structure to follow?

These questions are very common among freshers. And for that matter, we at **[House Of Geeks](https://houseofgeeks.netlify.app/)**, the technical society of **[IIIT Ranchi](https://iiitranchi.ac.in/)** have created a **Resources Library** for all the latest technologies and the way to learn more about them efficiently.

All in one place.

```bash
git commit -m "Let's upgrade our skills"
```
