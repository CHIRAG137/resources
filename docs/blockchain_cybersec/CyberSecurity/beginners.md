# For Beginners

Beginners can start to know about cybersecurity by watching a bunch of videos from different channels on youtube.
[This playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEiEAq2VkUUJfPOj5nRounXvf3n17PCft) by Simplilearn should be good for you.
Similarly we have a [playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ooVrP1hQOGPQVeapGsJCktzIO4DtI4_) by Edureka for the same.

If you are very new to this field, you must understand that you absolutely need to know and work on Linux to excel at Cybersec. [This file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zF3OUFv54CqW4IDzzNxy__KsFNqbyq8-/view?usp=sharing) has a curated list of linux commands which you will need while learning linux shell.

There are great resources available on [Tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/) and [Hackerone](https://www.hackerone.com/). These websites not only provide resources for learning ethical hacking and bug bounty testing, they also help in practicing them. These are great places to start with.

This [Netacad series for cybersecurity training](https://www.netacad.com/courses/cybersecurity) by Cisco is great free content for beginners.

Here are some playlists of live events which you would like to watch-

[Cybersec 1 | Techdrill](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmbh4Mw9r8AFUMWXSu-U9JQ0h2ltG7_1H)

[Cybersec 2 | Techdrill](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmbh4Mw9r8AFLBmlrifG49JBaDMIsq0Au)

[Cybersec 3 | Techdrill](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmbh4Mw9r8AFqKIB9WDXnBhy4ARZqSm26)

[This file](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kELY0IeUNTR4YOD-hawftnZj5osIVqxw) should be helpful for people in intermediate stage.

You can get courses for learning more on [StationX](https://www.stationx.net/) and [Hacker101](https://www.hacker101.com/).
If you find courses on Coursera and other platforms which are paid, you can look up for them on torrent. That will help you learn a lot. If you dont know how to use Torrent, set up a VPN and visit PirateBay or 1337x.to for finding courses, movies and stuff for free.
