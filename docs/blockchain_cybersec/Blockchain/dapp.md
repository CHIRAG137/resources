# DApp Development and Web 3.0

Decentralised Applications or DApps are the applications that work on Web 3.0 aand use a blockchain network, generally Ethereum in the background. Such web applications are different from the regular web applications we make.

You wont need more than a few months in order to learn how to make your own decentralised applications. Here are a few resources which will help you along the way-

The [article on the architecture of a web 3.0 application](https://www.preethikasireddy.com/post/the-architecture-of-a-web-3-0-application) written by Preethi Kasireddy is amazing. It explains in detail how a web 3.0 application can be made and what is the structure that we have to follow.

The developer onboarding starts with [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/), since there is no other chain as easy and useful as it. Explore the [docs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/) of Ethereum very carefully, you will definitely find resources that you can use.

When it comes to deployment and developing of actually usable dApps, Polygon stands as the most widely used EVM compatible chain. [Here](https://learn.figment.io/protocols/polygon) are a few resources placed by Figment which can help you in working with Polygon.

[Here](https://eattheblocks-pro.teachable.com/p/polygon-development) is a link to help you out with polygon development further. You should be able to enroll in the courses for free.

Apart from the knowledge of chains, you will also need to learn [cloud computing](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cloud-computing) and [cryptpograhpy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto).

The course by [Berkeley on Edx](https://www.edx.org/course/blockchain-technology) is well sought after for learning blockchain.

Other than these, learning proofs, security models, etc are a part of core blockchain but may be necessary for dApp development too. You can find them on white papers.
[This](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~suman/secure_sw_devel/secure_sw_devel.html) is a very useful resource for learning secure software development. It can be used beyond blockchain too.

A good knowledge of frameworks like Ethers.js, web3.js and others are also beneficial in development process. Also you need to have a good knowledge of solidity and smart contracts. You can find the assortment of such resources on Youtube very easily. [Dapp University](https://www.youtube.com/c/DappUniversity) is a very useful channel in this context. There are various playlists and videos focusing on various aspects of dapp development and covers the topics with the most recent technology. Follow the architecture of dapp article which has been posted in the beginning of this page and learn the certain frameworks and libraries as required.

[Metaschool](https://metaschool.so/) also has blogs and short video courses which will help you out.
The courses shared by me on the other articles also have tutorials on how to create a certain app here and there, look out for them.

[How to develop a decentralized application](https://topflightapps.com/ideas/how-to-build-dapps-decentralized-applications/) is a good article which you can use to get started with dapp development.
