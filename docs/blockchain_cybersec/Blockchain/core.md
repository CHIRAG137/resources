# Core Blockchain

As said earlier in the introduction section, core blockchain is a very different thing from dApp development. That being said, although there are new blockchain networks being developed everyday, it is not a high paying job for a person to be a core blockchain developer. Also, around 90% of the workforce in the industry is focused on development of the decentralised networks and applications along with Web 3.0.

The core blockchain is basically the part where you learn about the different chains, how they work and how can you contribute to them. This involves a lot of deal, hardwork and effort since you need to learn a lot - cloud computing, cryptography, secure development, networking, proofs and more. These domains are not yet explored by our society yet, but we are putting in efforts daily.

You should get started with the white papers to look at how the chains work and then get started in your required domain.
The course on Edx - [Blockchain: Understanding its uses and implications](https://www.edx.org/course/blockchain-understanding-its-uses-and-implications) covers a small part on core blockchain and tells you about the different domains that you can pursue in that area. Have a look at this course when you begin.

Apart from the knowledge of chains, you will also need to learn [cloud computing](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/cloud-computing) and [cryptpograhpy](https://www.coursera.org/learn/crypto).
The course by [Berkeley on Edx](https://www.edx.org/course/blockchain-technology) is well sought after for learning blockchain.
Other than these, learning proofs, security models, etc are a part of core blockchain but may be necessary for dApp development too. You can find them on white papers.
[This](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~suman/secure_sw_devel/secure_sw_devel.html) is a very useful resource for learning secure software development. It can be used beyond blockchain too.

There is a lot more which you will need to learn, but the study is almost equivalent to that of a M.Tech Course and hence out of our coverage area. But these resource should get you started with core blockchain. Keep checking the internet and other articles, books, etc under the Blockchain section to help yourself.
