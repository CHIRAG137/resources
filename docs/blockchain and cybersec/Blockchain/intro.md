# Introduction to Blockchain

Welcome to the community of Blockchain Technology of House of Geeks!

If you find yourself filled with enthusiasm when you hear about cryptocurrencies, NFTs, the Metaverse, Web 3.0 or anything related, and want to know how they work, this is the place for you to start. Here you shall find all the curated resources that will help you to begin with blockchain and master it with time.

## What Will You Find Here?

We shall learn what **Blockchain** is and how to understand the basics of it.

Here you will find the sections on where to get started with **Cryptocurrencies** such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, and how to learn **Solidity and Smart Contracts** and how to make your own **DApps** based on Web 3.0 and launch them.

We also have a section on **NFTs** so that you can understand what they are and how can you make one of your own

### Note 1

By the way, before you move on further, dApp development and learning core blockchain are two very different things. You have to be mindful of which line you are choosing and hence move on with it.

Core blockchain dev requires the study of multiple concepts like cloud computing, cryptography, state machines, and many logical concepts including proofs. Whereas, dApp development is mostly web development and conencting the applications to web 3.0 using frameworks and cryptocurrencies. But you should have a basic understanding of how blockchain works before statrting dApp development.

### Note 2

There exist an infinite number of resources - blogs, videos, courses, books and more - on the internet from where you can learn more about Bitcoin and Blockchain. It is not possible for us to list all of them here, however we have tried our best to get the best for you. You can still search for them on your own and if you want to contribute to the list here, you can set up a PR for it on our [Github repo](https://github.com/houseofgeeks/resources) and we will add them here. We will be thankful for your contributions!
