# How To Start?

Edureka's Blockchain course is the first thing we would recommend to anyone starting with blockchain. You can find it on youtube [here](https://youtu.be/QCvL-DWcojc).

This was a smaller version of an entire course that EdurekaIN made for students getting started with blockchain. This is a paid course and tbh pretty much costly. But this comes as a curated course filled with knowledge and resources at the same place. If you can afford it, go for it, but you can find the material on internet pretty easily. You can find the course [here](https://www.edureka.co/blockchain-training).

Edureka's YT channel has a [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9ooVrP1hQOFJblZm3OdcVV-H6Z8V7HP1) for blockchain related vidoes, you should give them a watch too. Most videos are focused on what blockchain is and covers the basics pretty nicely.

There are courses available elsewhere too which will get you started in almost no time. You can find them on:

1. [Edx](https://www.edx.org/learn/blockchain) - Here is an assortment of courses from some popular sources. You can avail them for free for a limited period of time.
2. [Dapp University](https://www.youtube.com/c/DappUniversity) - Dapp University is a popular YT channel famous for teaching blockchain related tech and provides content which is pretty much new and hence up to date with the current world.
3. Books and white papers are pretty good sources to get started with blockchain too. We have listed them in a section seperately for them.
4. [Metaschool](https://metaschool.so/) is a great place to learn about blockchain related stuff. It also has brief courses and articles on several topics to get you started.
