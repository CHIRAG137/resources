# Beginner

Of Course the first step has to be getting familiar with a language. 
If you are already familiar with an object oriented language then you can proceed further. 

But, in case you are an absolute beginner I would suggest you to go for **C++** as it's the most popular language for CP and most of the resources are C++ based.

## STL

Itâ€™s a set of template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions. It's a really powerful tool without which even solving the simplest of problems would be a real pain.

| Resource | Objective | Format | Pointers |
|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| [Competitive Programming/DSA Course (Hindi)](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLauivoElc3ggagradg8MfOZreCMmXMmJ-) | Learn/Practice | Videos | Watching and practicing till video 37 should be sufficient for this phase. You are contest ready at this point. |
| [Competitive Programmer's Handbook](https://usaco.guide/CPH.pdf) | Learn/Practice | Book/PDF | Reading till chapter 4 should be sufficient. |
| [[GYM] 100 Easy Problems (Bootcamp) - Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/97058) | Practice | Blog | Try to solve as much as you can. No need to go day wise. |

**Remember the goal here is to get familiar with the language and not to have a deep understanding of it.** 
Getting deep insights is something which can be done as you progress further in CP.
