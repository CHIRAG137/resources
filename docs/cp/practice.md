# Practice

The only way to get better at CP is practice! There are no shortcuts, you just have to grind through problems.

Here are some resources/roadmaps that may help you practice efficiently:

- [Competitive Programming roadmap resources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-7Co93b504uyXyMjjE8bnLJP3d3QXvp_m1UjvbvdR2Y/edit)
