# Intro

So you finally decided to immerse yourself into a painful, torturous but definitely fun experience of problem solving through data structures and algorithms.

The Community will be guiding you through the essence of data structures and algorithms which is nothing but Competitive Programming.

The journey of CP can be really exhausting and frustrating. It's often really helpful to have a list of relevant resources. 

**The resources provided here are a consequence of my limited experience in the field, so itâ€™s not at all recommended to follow each and everything.**

## Walkthrough

The various sections consist of tutorials, blogs or simply links that will help you learn **Data Structures and Algorithms** which are used quite often in CP.

**Note that the resources covered here are more CP oriented and not much DSA oriented.**
