# Intro

Hello there! So you decided to focus on development. Maybe you're looking forward to improve your resume, or maybe you're intruigued by how you can scroll youtube infinitely.

Well, this series of documentation is aimed to help you explore similar notions. Be advised that a lot of the topics discussed here are based on the popular and mainstream side of development.

## Walkthrough

The various sections consist of tutorials, blogs or simply links to **Web Development** and **DevOps** and a little bit of **Kernel Developement** and **Game Developement**.

Each of these sections will probably have a link to [roadmap.sh](http://roadmap.sh). This site provides a great visual to various paths. Keep in mind that a roadmap is not a solid and just method of working through. Its should be used as a tool to observe what all a particular field encapsulates. The progression can be followed vaguely and as per one's pace.
